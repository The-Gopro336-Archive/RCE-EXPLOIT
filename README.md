# PSA-MINERCRAFT-RCE-EXPLOIT
A new Minecraft exploit has been circulating, allowing remote code execution via Minecraft chat. It can be characterized by a period of lag whenever it is run. The message in chat example:

# How to check if you have been affected
Follow these steps
Tutorial for searching your Minecraft logs:
1. Extract the log files
2. Download and open Notepad++
3. Click Search > Find in Files
4. A new window will appear.
5. Under "Find what," type jndi:ldap
6. Under "Directory," Select your logs folder located in your Minecraft directory. Example: C:\Users\{Your Username Here}\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\logs
7. Click "Find All."
8. If you see jndi:LDAP appear, message rebane2001#3716 as he's the main guy investigating this.
^^ONLY MESSAGE HIM IF THIS STRING APPEARS IN YOUR LOGS^^

# If you have been affected
While the chat code exploit only affected your IP Address I would recommend resetting your PC anyways if you used the Minecraft launcher on 12/19/21 and before @23:00 EST or MultiMC and a java version under java 8_u191

# FIX

## NOTE: The JVM args **-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true** do NOT currently fix the exploit.
Restart your Minecraft launcher to get the new [config files](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/rczvr7/security_issue_minecraft_1181_release_candidate_3/)

Install latests java from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net) if you are using MultiMC and change your java version by pressing edit instance -> settings -> java installation -> auto detect -> choose the latest version of java 8 -> press ok

Biggest fix is just don't play Minecraft for a today, or a few days until there is a public and certain fix :)
